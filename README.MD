This is a Python3 utility library. It currently contains the following implementations:
 - Methods I use a lot
 - Binary Search Tree
 - Unweighted Graph
 - Weighted Graph
 - Basic LinkedList
 - Queue
 - A sorting algorithms util that contains Insertion, Selection, Bubble, Merge, Quick, and Counting sorting algorithms along with a benchmarking function for those sorts.

I am very slowly adding to this. My latest addition is the automation.py -- it is used to automate different tasks on a computer. I mainly use the functions in there to make my life easier by opening programs and logging into them automatically. It saves me a bit of effort.
