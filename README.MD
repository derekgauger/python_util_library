This is a Python3 utility library. It currently contains the following implementations:
 - Methods I use a lot
 - Binary Search Tree
 - Unweighted Graph
 - Weighted Graph
 - Basic LinkedList
 - Queue
 - A sorting algorithms util that contains Insertion, Selection, Bubble, Merge, and Quick sorting algorithms along with a benchmarking function for those sorts.

I will be adding to this as time goes on, I just contribute whenever I have time. All of this code was of my own creation, feel free to use it for anything. 
I am not sure who else will be looking at this, but if you have suggestions for utilities I can put in here to increase my chance of being hired somewhere, please message me: gaugerderek@gmail.com
